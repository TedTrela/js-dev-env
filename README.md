==========

This is the repo follow along from the PluralSight course:  Building a JavaScript Development Environment
Cory House

It was well worth the time invested.  A lotta stuff on npm and webpack, along with linting, testing, etc.
Except for the webpack stuff which was new for me, I had some familiarity with the rest - however this course 
tied it all together in a nice fashion.
